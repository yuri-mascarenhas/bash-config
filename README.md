# Bash configuration
This repository contains a [.bashrc](.bashrc) configuration file with some useful alias that I gathered over the years.\
The alias in this file are suited for those who, like me, uses a lot of git bash terminal or some UNIX like kind of terminal.

## How to use it
1. Copy the [.bashrc](.bashrc) file to your home folder `~` for **User Specific** configuration.\
1.1.  or `/etc/bash.bashrc` for a **System wide** configuration.\
1.2. in this case, rename the file to **bash.bashrc**
2. Restart all instances of bash previously open so changes are loaded.
